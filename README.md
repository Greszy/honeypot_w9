# Project 10 - Honeypot

Time spent: **24** hours spent in total

> Objective: Setup a honeypot and provide a working demonstration of its features.

### Required: Overview & Setup

- [x] A basic writeup (250-500 words) on the `README.md` desribing the overall approach, resources/tools used, findings

When it comes to working with honeypots my first decision is to understand what kind of honeypot would like I like to use. Honeypots come in different shapes and sizes. They can mimic different kind kinds of applications. We have [different implementations of honeypots] (https://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/guide-different-kinds-honeypots). Some present vulnerable real applications and collect data through a honeywall about the occurring attacks. Others just emulate vulnerabilities rather than expose a real application. 

For this assignment, I used two Vagrant virtual machines, one that is my target (honeypot) and a server one that runs my admin console for monitoring data collected by the honeypot. I used Modern Honey Network (http://threatstream.github.io/mhn/) that helps you quickly implement and efficiently manage honeypots and provides you with an array of tools to analyze data provided by the honeypots. Through MHN I can track type of attacks, date, time, region where the attack comes from, source IP, destination of the attack and many more. The tool letâ€™s you manage multiple different honeypots at the same time. 


- [ ] A specific, reproducible honeypot setup, ideally automated. There are several possibilities for this:
	- A Vagrantfile or Dockerfile which provisions the honeypot as a VM or container
	- A bash script that installs and configures the honeypot for a specific OS
	- Alternatively, **detailed** notes added to the `README.md` regarding the setup, requirements, features, etc.

### Required: Demonstration

- [ ] A basic writeup of the attack (what offensive tools were used, what specifically was detected by the honeypot)
- [ ] An example of the data captured by the honeypot (example: IDS logs including IP, request paths, alerts triggered)
- [ ] A screen-cap of the attack being conducted
    
### Optional: Features
- Honeypot
	- [ ] HTTPS enabled (self-signed SSL cert)
	- [ ] A web application with both authenticated and unauthenticated footprint
	- [ ] Database back-end
	- [ ] Custom exploits (example: intentionally added SQLI vulnerabilities)
	- [ ] Custom traps (example: modified version of known vulnerability to prevent full exploitation)
	- [ ] Custom IDS alert (example: email sent when footprinting detected)
	- [ ] Custom incident response (example: IDS alert triggers added firewall rule to block an IP)
- Demonstration
	- [ ] Additional attack demos/writeups
	- [ ] Captured malicious payload
	- [ ] Enhanced logging of exploit post-exploit activity (example: attacker-initiated commands captured and logged)
